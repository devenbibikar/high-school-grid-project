# A Java program designed to determine the path of a an object that moves through a grid. 
# If the object hits the wall, it turns right, if it can. 
# The program traces the path of the object to find the eventual permanent path and all the locations that the object lands on. 
# Config Files can be written, read, and saved in this program.
